cstar_perf
==========

cstar_perf is a performance testing platform for Apache Cassandra. 

In a mostly automated fashion, it can do the following:

* Download and build Cassandra source code
* Download and setup DSE binaries
* Configure and bootstrap nodes
* Run stress workloads
* Capture performance metrics
* Create reports and charts comparing different configs/workloads
* Webserver frontend for scheduling tests, viewing prior runs, and
  monitoring test clusters.
